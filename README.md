I’m a versatile quick-learning Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience across mobile, full-stack, and backend development—now actively transitioning into backend, cloud and AI engineering roles. Though I began with a strong focus on Flutter, I’ve consistently demonstrated the ability to pick up new technologies quickly and deliver end-to-end solutions.

Early in my career, I stepped beyond Flutter to build a real-time video conferencing app using React Native, bridging native WebRTC libraries for Android and iOS. More recently, I’ve been working on backend systems using Golang (Gin)—building and deploying microservices on AWS, designing REST APIs, integrating Stripe for payments, handling FCM notifications, and working with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Meilisearch for data and search needs.

Alongside this, I’ve developed a growing interest in AI engineering. I’ve worked on multiple projects using LangChain, Pinecone, FastAPI, and Firebase to build RAG-based chat systems, transcript generators for conference videos, and multi-modal AI pipelines that process PDFs and images. These experiences have strengthened my backend experience and sparked a deep curiosity about the intersection of scalable systems and intelligent interfaces.

I take pride in writing clean, testable code (unit/widget tests with Mockito/Mocktail), designing modular architectures (MVVM, Bloc, sealed classes), and contributing reusable packages—such as a Flutter animation package published on pub.dev.

I thrive in fast-paced, learning-focused environments where I can solve real-world problems and grow alongside cutting-edge technologies. My current focus is on roles that allow me to deepen my backend and cloud skills and contribute meaningfully to AI-driven products.
